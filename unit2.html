        <h3>Q  1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page</h3>
        </div>


        <p class="unit1answer">Seeing as the project developed more over the duration of the course I have sought to created a simple and readable design for all users. I have created a Nav bar that includes 4 different pages: “About me, Unit 1, Unit 2 and the Home Page”. I have included the Contact me content on the Home page as part of the design of the webpage and I kept the same nav bar consistent on every page by styling different particular class selectors and elements. I have defined all elements in a folder that constrains all HTML codes.
            Afterwards I have set a background page for all pages, as I am passionate about travelling I have set several photos within the same theme. I have further styled the content of the page within a CSS page and specific element selectors for the body part of the code. I have used Google Fonts to further select my desired font. I have also separated each question and answer by different class selectors for easier readability and accessibility. </p>

        <h3>Q 1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites </h3>
        </div>

        <p class="unit1answer">The copy rights of an author’s work are automatically acknowledged without having to register their work, additionally they can be uploaded via Github. However, all copyright policies have an expiration date alongside the lifespan of an author life even up to 70 years after his death. It is illegal to share or use any of the documentation that belongs to another author, specifically whenever you are creating a website and you utilize other people’s data or code, we are required to use and create our own original pieces or either have explicit authorization from other individuals. 
            When using a database, software and search engine it is also needs to check the licensing agreement to avoid any legal issues, perhaps consult a lawyer for further advice. It is also notable to check if the website domain has been registered before to avoid the infringement of other individual’s rights.

            them</h3>
        </div>

        <p class="unit1answer">It is important to think how to make websites accessible to different individuals that suffer from various degrees of disabilities. Websites that include gifs or videos should not include sudden imagery that could trigger seizures for many individuals, ie: in the case of epilepsy, therefore it is important to be considerate of all individual and user needs when designing and creating a website. Depending on the needs of others there are other accessible tools to assist users such as video subtitles or individuals that suffer from hearing difficulties and describe captions to be able and provide more support. If an image does not include images people that have visual difficulties might not see vital information. One of the most rudimental narratives of HTML represents the possibility to add on a tag and describe a video or photo

        <h3>Q 1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites</h3>
        </div>


        <p class="unit1answer">The most common types of files are CSS, PNG, HTML, JPG/JPEG. 
            HTML – short for Hyper Text Mark-up Language, represents the skeleton of a webpage and it includes everything from content to particular tags in the structure of the HTML file and it explains specific divisions on the webpage, from division of classes to where paragraphs start, end, line breaks and to specific styling of text in italic or bold. A similar file or document ends in .html.
            CSS – short for Cascading Style Sheets, used together with HTML they create the content of webpages to display the information and present it in a pleasing way, A CSS file can be used as a separate file from a HTML file in the scope of being more organized. The CSS feature permits software developers to create more interesting pages by adding and editing fonts, their sizes, background images, etc
            PNG/JPEG – are the most common names used for files. Contrasting PNG files JPEG files are more lossy, therefore each time we open and save a new photo it reduces it’s quality.
            MP3/MP4 – are files that are mostly used to contain videos and audios.  Some other popular files are also GIFS & SVG.
