        <h3>Q 1.2	Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully </h3>
        </div>


        <p class="unit1answer">Successful digital project leaders are required to understand the needs and complexities of each project to manage their full software development life cycle (SDLC) and an ability to learn new concepts and apply them across various organizations and industries. The Kanban method has been used by our team and has allowed organizations to create, drive changes and visualize work-flows. I have developed my organizational and time management skills and I have further developed my passion for problem solving skills when applying programming languages. I have ensured that I applied my skills with great accuracy and attention to detail. Moreover, a project leader should have an inquisitive mind and demonstrate resourcefulness when working with databases.
           </p>

        <div class="unit1heading3">
        <h3>Q 1.3	Plan and carry out tasks using IT  </h3>
        </div>

        <p class="unit1answer">The first principal that applies to many professions, particularly in tech, represents the ability to learn and master a programming language. I have learned to use tools such as Visual Studio, Trello board and developed existing and new key sets of skills as future developers. required team work and collaboration, great communication skills and writing skills when writing code (ie: HTML, CSS, Javascript, etc). Trello represented a great project management application in realizing in time successful collaborations between individuals on multiple projects and teams.  By using the Kanban method I have managed to assign different task cards efficiently across during each day of the project and increase productivity, task and workflow management, time and issue tracking and testing. Thus by facilitating better visibility I increased predictability of the project and the website by creating the website and keeping processes consistent and stable and have eliminated bottlenecks.</p>

        <h3>Q 1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects </h3>
        </div>


        <p class="unit1answer">Digital processes often involve risk mitigation to address risk in developing projects, especially during the planning process. By investing time at the beginning of a project, we plan and manage risk head-on by better preparing for the unexpected. Scalability, accuracy of functionality, compatibility when developing projects are all key points. 
            Not understanding the business and IT processes are amongst the few causes those digital projects fail as they create inefficiencies. Other issues such as poor project management, connectivity problems, limited digital strategy when delivering team projects, damaging devices and not being diligent when saving your work represent several other common concerns.

        <h3>Q 1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software</h3>
        </div>


        <p class="unit1answer">Code Nation has empowered and thought students to fully immerse themselves in the curriculum by taking advantage of all the necessary tools required during the period of teaching, especially considering the effects ofCovid-19 pandemic and it’s affects on education and across businesses. 
            I have successfully delivered all key components of the course by interacting with teachers and students in real time across different platforms like Slack, Zoom and Trello , planned and communicated efficiently and developed codes via Visual Studio. Being connected and receiving support via multiple intranet lines such as LAN and WAN was crucial. I have used my laptop to code and write all written assignments and other devices with high portability, ie: telephpne, ipad, and connected to the WIFI in a remote workplace at a local coffee shop. All the work produced was published via Github to increase my employment chances.
            </p>

        <div class="unit1heading3">
        <h3>Q 1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes.</h3>
        </div>


        <p class="unit1answer">Trello has been a great visual collaboration tool as it was on a Kanban board, both for working in teams and individually. It has included a series of lists, with a variety of task cards that have helped me increase productivity over the duration of the course and has helped me know when to take action by organizing and visualizing my workflow. I have added the outcomes of the project with a WIP limit as the symbols turns from red to green once a task is completed. This has helped determine me to finish the tasks before moving on to another one. Storing my code and files on Git has been quite useful as it has given me the ability to create branches and it has allowed me to try and set out various ideas in my code. I have been able to access my code in a safe storage in a cloud-based system. Thus it provides me the ability to create and branch out on various possibilities of code no matter where I am in the time zone in a repo system/ master folder and I can collaborate with other individuals to help make improvements on my code.

        <h3>Q 1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects </h3>
        </div>

        <p class="unit1answer">In 2018 the EU commission has created the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, to monitor how businesses handle and process data. This act has replaced previous data protection legislations from the 1990s and was created to protect the privacy and rights of individuals. Considering the economic and social integration of markets, rapid technological advancements and the availability of public data used both by corporations and individuals both has led to a staggering increase in cross-border flows of data.
            GDPR requires consent to use data, and ensures a consistent level of protection for all individuals to prevent the movement of personal data within the internal market. Individuals can face prosecution for data protection breaches and contains provisions that certain disclosure of personal data is a criminal offence under UK law.

        <div class="unit1heading3">
        <h3>Q 2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello</h3>
        </div>

        <p class="unit1answer">I have continuously reviewed, tweaked and fine tuned the project by taking advantage of all the resources and ensured the successfully delivery of the project by the deadline. I have developed problem solving skills and implemented immediate solutions to unexpected errors encountered through the use of the method of trail and error when developing the code part of the project. With the help of Visual Studio and Trello I recorded all evidence in this document to ensure that I follow a rigorous plan when further developing my ideas. Thus, a successful project does not need continuous maintenance after its’ completion as it should be working efficiently all throughout its life-cycle once completed.</p>
            </p>
        
        <div class="unit1heading3">
        <h3>Q 2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate </h3>
        </div>

        <p class="unit1answer">The IT tools, resources and methodologies implemented were adequate for the successful completion of the project. I have used a Macbook air with a OS platform that has a built in anti-virus and helped me lower any extra costs that would deter the functionality and achievability of the project or could affect any other programs used such as Visual Code, Trello, Google Docs and search engines such as Google Chrome and Mozilla, etc.
            I was able to make rational judgments considering all the implications of the project customize the interface of the project and become more creative whilst testing all the elements learned throughout the course that was provided by Code Nation. Some of the tools used by the org were straightforward, such as Trello, however Visual Studio and the developing side of the code was more interesting however it required more time to understand. The network speed was satisfactory and I have not encountered any issues whilst writing my final piece of work.            
            </p>

        <div class="unit1heading3">
        <h3>Q 2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?</h3>
            </div>
    
        <p class="unit1answer">I have regularly monitored the development of the project and I have conducted a full qualitative analysis upon until it’s completion. I believe that the external limitation of time has slightly affected the project as we have had very little time to do more research and place all the new knowledge learned into application effectively and efficiently. If the conditions could have been ideal and we did not have fast approaching deadlines every week the quality of the projects would have been higher.
            I resolved ad-hoc dilemmas that have occurred during the planning of the project with the program coordinator and presented the finished product when the project was ready and deemed fit to be made public. Consequentially, I have successfully assessed all the risks involved through the testing and trial phase and feel confident with the project. 
            </p>

         <div class="unit1heading3">

        <h3>Q 2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h3>
        </div>

        <p class="unit1answer">I have taken into account both weakness and strengths in the analysis and the evaluation of the project and I have successfully corrected all errors encountered whilst I constantly improving the interoperability of the project (ie: website) by adhering and adopting new standards. The limitations of time and knowledge have been a limiting factor in reaching the full extent of the project and adding more features, however as much as it had both a negative and positive aspects these constraints have pushed me to learn new technologies and use IT services. 
            Given the time constraints that I have had to write a feasible code for the project I could have perhaps used a cleaner version and find new and creative ways to make it shorter. I have checked the descriptions of the guidance forms for this project and aimed to remain within the guidelines whilst letting go to the creative side and go above and beyond to ensure that the project exceed all expectations. 
            </p>

        <div class="unit1heading3">
        <h3>Q 2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h3>
            </div>
    
        <p class="unit1answer">I have reviewed all the outcomes considering the successful completion of the project, from the planning stage, it’s execution to the project’s evaluation. I have carefully outlined a plan using the Trello board and utilized the course guidelines to built the required website. I have matched all the course requirements by following the appropriate standards and guidelines and ensured that the project is fit for all audiences, including the upload of the code on Github and design of the website so that it is easily readable.
            I have found the testing and review to be most insightful as I have managed to resolve any troubleshooting some issues with the code by checking each individual link and occurred.

        <div class="unit1heading3">
        <h3>Q 3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?</h3>
        </div>

        <p class="unit1answer">The IT tools that have been used to develop this website have increased efficiency since the creation of the project. It has successfully improved productivity and reduced working time. Moreover, with the help of Zoom Teams and Slack we were able to successfully communicate on previous projects and imput all our efforts collectively. 
            One drawback during the development of the project was the necessary additional planning time required to invest in the project, further reduce work.
        </p>

        <div class="unit1heading3">
        <h3>Q 3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h3>
            </div>
    
        <p class="unit1answer">Considering the recent epistemological developments globally working remotely has increased my productivity as time to travel to meetings was reduced and we have spent more time on the core tasks as a whole team. Whilst the deadline of each project was on a weekly basis we were constantly engaged and had a free flow of communication to ensure that the team meets all the deadlines of the projects.
            Github is a very trustworthy platform where all developers could continue and add more codes to an open source community and individuals and teams can continue to work efficiently and improve on existing codes. There has been a plethora of developers bringing in new ideas and diversity without any time lost during stand-ups, meetings or unnecessary travel time to their offices. Having a clear vision of a plan for the project was necessary at the commencement of a new project has overall improved efficiency as all tasks were broken down revised collective and independently by all team members across various parts of the project. 
            </p>

        <div class="unit1heading3">
        <h3>Q 3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects </h3>
        </div>

        <p class="unit1answer">Working along with other team members via Slack Zoom and has lead to better brainstorming sessions, collaborations and it has increased productivity which lead to a better overall design of all projects.
            Given the correct timeframe of all future projects, I would invest more time in helping fellow colleagues fix troubleshooting issues that they had and increase more time spending on the layout of the website and the code side of the project. I would also invest more time trying various ideas without a end plan to explore and discover new possibilities of coding.
            </p>

        <div class="unit1heading3">
        <h3>Q 3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h3>
            </div>
    
        <p class="unit1answer">All testers and web developers need to have a testing framework to ensure the best predictability and outcomes, thus it is best to use methodologies like Dev Ops or Agile as a standardized framework for all testers that they can follow. With the increased  availability of testing tools and support and with the help of Artificial Intelligence tools, testers can focus on the key area that have failed on a project. Testing as a alfa & beta model could potentially provide a better and wider perspective and 
            There are different methodologies to ensure that the final product or project is successful, One could be the possibility of getting other team members involved to test the product can be beneficial to the life-cycle of the project and see how others users can interact with any failures within the code and how they could offer fresh insights and solutions to resolve them. Such a methodology is popular within the gaming industry where players are provided access and test the new features of products where individuals can become part of a community and test games so that they can provide feedback to the creators and fix any bugs.
